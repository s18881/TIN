		<p>
			Naruto Uzumaki (うずまき ナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is the titular protagonist of the series. He was the first character created by Kishimoto during the conception of the series and was designed with many traits from other shōnen characters. He is often ridiculed by the Konohagakure villagers, as he is the host of <a class="link" href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Kurama">Kurama</a>, the Nine-Tailed Fox that attacked Konoha. He compensates for this with his cheerful and boisterous personality, vowing to never give up on any goal he sets. In particular, Naruto has ambitions of becoming Hokage, the leader of Konohagakure, to gain the villagers' respect and be able to protect both them and the world. Over the course of the series, Naruto befriends many foreign and Konoha people and eventually gains a sizable positive impact on their lives to the point where he gains worldwide fame.

		<p>
		Sasuke Uchiha (うちは サスケ, Uchiha Sasuke) is Naruto's rival. He was designed by Kishimoto as the "cool genius" since he felt this was an integral part of an ideal rivalry.[1] Sasuke's older brother, Itachi Uchiha, killed the rest of their family.[ch. 224] Because of this, Sasuke's sole desire is to kill his brother, and he develops a cold and withdrawn personality, seeing people as tools to further his goals, although also gaining the affection of most of the girls he knows, much to his annoyance. After he becomes a member of Team 7, Sasuke seems to begin considering his teammates precious to the point of risking his life to protect them, while focusing on revenge less than at the start of the series. Following an encounter and a subsequent defeat at the hands of his brother in Part I, however, Sasuke severs his ties and leaves the village to seek more power from a man named <a class="link" href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Orochimaru">Orochimaru</a>. By the events of the Boruto franchise, Sasuke has become a vigilante investigating the Otsutsuki clan while aiding Konohagakure..

			Sakura Haruno (春野 サクラ, Haruno Sakura) is a member of Team 7. While creating the character, <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masashi_Kishimoto">Kishimoto</a> has admitted that he had little perception of what an ideal girl should be like. As a child, Sakura was teased by other children because of her large forehead, a feature Kishimoto tried to emphasize in Sakura's appearance. She was comforted by Ino Yamanaka and the two developed a friendship. However, as the two continued to grow, they became increasingly distant due to their shared affection for Sasuke Uchiha. During the early moments of Part I, Sakura is infatuated with Sasuke and resents Naruto Uzumaki, although Sasuke views her as "annoying" and Naruto has feelings for her. Her perception on Naruto eventually changes, however, and she comes to see him as a friend, while her feelings for Sasuke grow into deep love.
